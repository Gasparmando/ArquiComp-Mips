WARNING:Pack:2574 - The F7 multiplexer symbol
   "debut_unit/Mmux_n[8]_X_194_o_wide_mux_6_OUT_16_f7" and its I1 input driver
   "debut_unit/Mmux_n[8]_X_194_o_wide_mux_6_OUT_1718" were implemented
   suboptimally in the same slice component. The function generator could not be
   placed directly driving the F7 multiplexer. The design will exhibit
   suboptimal timing.

  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
